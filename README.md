# A Novel Approach to Resolving the P vs NP Problem

Luke Tonon, December 2024

## Introduction

The question of whether **P = NP** is one of the most fundamental and unresolved problems in computer science and mathematics, with profound implications for computation, optimization, and complexity theory.

This text presents a novel approach to resolving this question by exploring the connection between logical transformations in algorithms and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.

## Algorithms and Logical Transformations

All non-quantum algorithms operate by performing a sequence of logical transformations on bits. These transformations take existing information as input and produce new information as output. This is a widely known and accepted characteristic of algorithms.

## The Role of Solvers

Some algorithms, known as **solvers**, differ in that they must produce an answer relative to a desired set of rules. For example, a SAT solver must produce a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses of a given formula—this output is constrained by logical rules.

## The Novel Connection

The novel connection proposed here is that solvers, when viewed abstractly, are systems that attempt to transform information following one set of rules (input constraints) into information that adheres to another set of rules (desired output). This abstraction mirrors Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, which describe the limits of provability within formal systems.

## Gödel’s Theorems and Their Implications

Gödel’s incompleteness theorems show that in any sufficiently expressive formal system, there exist true statements that cannot be proven—truths that cannot be derived through logical deduction alone. This insight implies that solvers, in attempting to produce true outputs relative to a set of rules, may encounter scenarios where proof-based methods cannot succeed.

### The Necessity of Guessing

In such cases, solvers must rely on "guessing" or brute force to arrive at the truth. This guessing process inherently requires exploring multiple possibilities, leading to time complexities that are not polynomial. As a result, some problems in **NP** truly do not belong to **P**.

## Conclusion

This framework provides a novel lens for understanding the distinction between **P** and **NP**, grounded in the fundamental limits of logical deduction. While this approach feels deeply correct, I urge the mathematics and computer science communities to rigorously examine and evaluate its implications.
